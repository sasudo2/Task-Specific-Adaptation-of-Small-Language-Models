The dataset was created by first taking in name of .py files from dataset provided by Abhishek Chaudhary then normalize the name then creating a dictionary with name as key and code as value. Then the key was matched with \"title\" in dataset provided by gzipChrist and the coded was added to that dataset if a match for name was found."
