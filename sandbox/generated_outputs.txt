You are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to generate correct, efficient Python code.
- Write only the function implementation
- Do not include markdown code blocks
- Do not include explanations
- The code must be syntactically correct
- There must be proper indentation.
- you will be given function signature create the program that fints into the function signature.<</SYS>>
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: [/INST]
The solution is a list of indices where each element contains one index from the original array and one index from the new array.
For example, with nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, the result should be [1,3].
Your solution can be in any language.
If your solution runs out of memory or time limit, it will be considered incorrect.
You may assume that the number of elements does not exceed 20, and all the integers in the array are in the range [-100, 100].

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it. If it doesn't exist, return -1.
def firstUniqueChar(str: str) -> int: [/INST]
The solution is a function that takes a string as input and returns the first unique character in it.
If there is no unique character in the string, the function should return -1.

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
def isValid(s: str) -> bool: [/INST]
The digits 0 through 9 inclusive are represented by the characters '0', '1', ... ,'9'.
The letters A through Z inclusive are represented by the characters 'A', 'B', ... ,'Z'.
Lowercase letters a through z inclusive are represented by the characters 'a', 'b', ... ,'z'.
An empty string is a valid input.
If the character at index i in s is one of '(' or '[', then the characters at indices i+1 and i+2 in s must be the same.
If the character at index i in s is one of ')' or ']', then the characters at indices i+1 and i+2 in s must be the same.
If the character at index i in s is one of '{' or '}', then the characters at indices i+1 and i+2 in s must be the same.
If the character at index i in s is one of ' ', then it must be followed by exactly one character from the set {'(', '[', '{', '}', ']'} and preceded by exactly one character from the set {')', ']', '}'}.
If the character at index i in s is one of ' ', then it must be followed by exactly one character from the set {'(', '[', '{', '}', ']'} and preceded by exactly one character from the set {')', ']', '}'}.
If the character at index i in s is one of ' ', then it must be followed by exactly one character from the set {'(', '[', '{', '}', ']'} and preceded by exactly one character from the set {')', ']', '}'}.
