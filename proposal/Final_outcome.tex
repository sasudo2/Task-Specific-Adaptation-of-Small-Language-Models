\chapter{Expected Outcome}

\begin{normaltext}This model is expected to generate python code based on the provided textual prompt
using OPT-350M. The fine-tuned model is expected to achieve higher accuracy than OPT-350M in python code generation specific domain which is expected to answer with higher accuracy to LeetCode problems. This model also focuses
on human readability by providing extra comments and docstring wherever required.
\vspace{18 pt}

The fine-tuned model will be runnable in low specification devices with higher
accuracy than the previous model and A common end goal in the field of code
generation is to generate functional and deployable end-to-end systems that can be used
in real-world settings.
